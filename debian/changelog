  * Merge pull request #72 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/issues/72> from pal-robotics/minor-maintenance
    Minor maintenance
  * Default stop_trajectory_duration to zero. Refs #73 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/issues/73>
  * Better logs when dropping traj points. Refs #68 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/issues/68>.
  * Fix class member reorder warning in constructor.
  * Add missing headers to target files.
  * Action interface rejects empty goals. Fixes #70 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/issues/70>.
  * Reorder how time and traj data are updated.
    In the update method, fetching the currently executed trajectory should be done
    before updating the time data to prevent a potential scenario in which there
    is no trajectory defined for the current control cycle.
  * Work tolerance checking methods.
    Until now we used the currently active goal handle for performing tolerance
    checks. Using the goal handle stored in segments is more robust to unexpected
    goal updates by the non-rt thread.
  * Refactor how the currrent trajectory is stored.
    - Handle concurrency in the current trajectory between rt and non-rt threads
    using the simpler RealtimeBox instead of the RealtimeBuffer, because our
    usecase does not fit well the non-rt->writes / rt->reads semantics.
    - As a consequence we no longer need to store the msg_trajectory member, but
    only the hold_trajectory, which must still be preallocated.
  * Honor unspecified vel/acc in ROS message. Fix #65 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/issues/65>.
  * Fixes per Adolfo
  * Added verbose flag
  * Fixing realtime issues
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' into joint_trajectory_tweaks
  * Tweaked error messages
  * Added more debug info
  * Fix for microsecond delay that caused header time=0 (now) to start too late
  * Reworded debug message
  * Image update.
  * Update README.md
    Factor out user documentation to the ROS wiki.
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of https://github.com/willowgarage/ros_controllers into hydro-devel
  * Rename hold_trajectory_duration
    - hold_trajectory_duration -> stop_trajectory_duration for more clarity.
    - During Hydro, hold_trajectory_duration will still work, giving a deprecation
    warning.
  * Add basic description in package.xml.
  * Add images used in the ROS wiki doc.
  * Added better debug info
  * Throttled debug output
  * Added more debug and error information

  * joint_trajectory_controller: New package implementing a controller for executing joint-space trajectories on a
    set of joints.
    
      * ROS API
        
          * Commands: FollowJointTrajectory action and trajectory_msgs::JointTrajectory topic.
          * Current controller state is available in a control_msgs::JointTrajectoryControllerState topic.
          * Controller state at any future time can be queried through a control_msgs::JointTrajectoryControllerState
            service.
        
      * Trajectory segment type
        
          * Controller is templated on the segment type.
          * Multi-dof quintic spline segment implementation provided by default.
        
      * Hardware interface type
        
          * Controller is templated on the hardware interface type.
          * Position and effort control joint interfaces provided by default.

          * Realtime-safe.
          * Proper handling of wrapping (continuous) joints.
          * Discontinuous system clock changes do not cause discontinuities in the execution of already queued
            trajectory segments.
