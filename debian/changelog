  * Add base_frame_id param (defaults to base_link)
    The nav_msgs/Odometry message specifies the child_frame_id field,
    which was previously not set.
    This commit creates a parameter to replace the previously hard-coded
    value of the child_frame_id of the published tf frame, and uses it
    in the odom message as well.
